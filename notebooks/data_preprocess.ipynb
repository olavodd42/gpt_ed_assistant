She is tired of \"fighting\" her end stage \nliver disease and does not feel that she has a good quality of \nlife. She wished to meet with a representative from hospice, \nwhich we were able to arrange, and she decided that she would \nlike to go home with hospice. A conversation was held with the \npatient regarding code status. She noted that she would probably \nbe DNR/DNI, but would like to discuss it with her son (HCP). \nTherefore, at this time, she remains full code.

She was continued on rifaximin and lactulose \nin-house and at discharge.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n==============\n\n# Hyponatremia - The patient has a history of asymptomatic \nhyponatremia. It is most likely hypervolemic hyponatremia \nrelated to underlying liver disease as well as aldosterone axis \ndysfunction related to liver disease. She remained asymptomatic \nthrough her hospitalization. Because she was also started on \n10mg of furosemide to help prevent fluid re-accumulation, she \nwill require BMPs twice weekly in the outpatient setting.\n\n# HIV: Emtricitabine-Tenofovir (Truvada) and Raltegravir were \ncontinued in-house and at discharge.  \n\n# COPD: fluticasone, tiotropium and albuterol were continued \nin-house and at discharge.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n===================\n[ ] Follow-up peritoneal fluid culture\n[ ] New/changed medications: Furosemide 10mg daily (new)\n[ ] For hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, the patient should have \nbiweekly BMPs (script written).

You \nwere admitted because of worsening abdominal pain. It is likely \nthat this pain was due to increasing fluid in the abdomen from \nyour cirrhosis. After a paracentesis in which much of this fluid \nwas removed, your pain improved significantly. You were noted to \nhave a high potassium during your hospitalization, which came \ndown with treatment but this should continue to be followed as \nan outpatient. You also emphasized your desire to speak with a \nrepresentative from hospice. Because of your repeated \nparacenteses, we also discussed the possibility of a pleurex \ncatheter placement. We arranged for you to meet with hospice \ncoordinators, and you will be discharged home with hospice.\n\nWe wish you all the best!\n\nYour ___ care team\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"

For his gait freezing, his mirapex was increased by\n0.125 mg every week to a goal dose of 0.75 mg t.i.d. He\nsuccessfully up-titrated the medicine to 0.75/0.625/0.625 but\nbegan to have visual hallucinations and confusion so on ___ his\nneurologist recommended decreasing the dose to 0.625 TID. \nDespite\nthe changes to his Mirapex, the patient's daughter has noted\nprogressive gait stiffness and increased difficulty standing.\nThis has resulted in difficulty with simply getting to the\nbathroom leading to episodes of incontinence.

FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or infarction. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. The basal cisterns appear patent and there is preservation of gray-white matter differentiation. No fracture is identified. The visualized paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are clear. The globes are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process."

There is minimal decrease of the soft tissue swelling. Joint space heights are within normal limits. IMPRESSION: Less-evident fracture lines, suggesting callus formation and continued healing.

The endometrium is slightly heterogeneous, but there is no focal mass. No abnormal areas of blood flow are visualized. The ovaries are normal bilaterally. There is no extra-ovarian adnexal mass to suggest an ectopic pregnancy. There is no free fluid. IMPRESSION: Slightly heterogeneous endometrium, but no focal mass to suggest retained products."

There is cortical thinning and irregularity overlying the lateral cortex of the femoral shaft near the stem of the prosthesis with two nearby hyperdense fragments, possibly small dystrophic calcifications or cement from an older prosthesis, although this does not appear to represent an acute finding. The right hip joint appears severely narrowed. The sacroiliac joints are incompletely assessed but appear narrowed. Degenerative changes are incompletely characterized along the lower lumbar spine. The bones appear demineralized. Vascular calcifications are present. IMPRESSION: Mixed sclerotic changes and thinning where the distal femoral stem closely approaches the cortex.
